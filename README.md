# GenAI-SOC-Automation
Mock GenAI SOC automation project

Genai Soc Readme
🔐 GenAI-Powered SOC Automation (Mock Version)
Overview

This project demonstrates a Mock GenAI SOC automation workflow. It simulates how security alerts from a SIEM (like Splunk or Wazuh) can be analyzed automatically and converted into incident reports.

Fully offline (no API key needed)

Beginner-friendly and safe for GitHub

Demonstrates Python + Cybersecurity integration

🧩 How It Works

Reads JSON alerts from the alerts/ folder.

Uses a Mock GenAI function to analyze alerts:

Summarizes the alert

Assigns severity

Maps to MITRE ATT&CK

Suggests response actions

Generates a Markdown incident report in reports/incident_report.md.

⚡ How to Explore (Safe Version)

This project uses a Mock GenAI script to generate incident reports from alerts.
Since it’s fully offline, you don’t need to run it to see the workflow.

Check the folder structure and sample files:

alerts/splunk_alert.json → Example alert

reports/incident_report.md → Example report

Optional: To generate reports locally (if you trust your environment):

cd C:\Users\Neeraja\Desktop\GenAI-SOC-Automation  
python scripts/genai_alert_triage.py  

⚠️ Running the script is safe in your own environment, but you don’t need it to explore or understand the project.
